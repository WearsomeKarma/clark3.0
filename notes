fix showcases toggle
for new_discussion, when leaving focus of video_url - slide in an IFrame for the youtube video


CSS-beautify the showcase components - (its a mess... code wise.)
Add search bar functionality - this is just getJSON with a query object.
Add discussion search numbers. So, show a max of 10 discussions, and the remainder
    are accessed by a page index (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 10, 11)
